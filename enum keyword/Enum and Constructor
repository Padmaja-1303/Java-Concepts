/*enum and Constructor:  

enum can contain a constructor and it is executed separately for each enum constant
at the time of enum class loading.
We can’t create enum objects explicitly and hence we can’t invoke enum constructor directly.

enum and Methods:  

enum can contain both concrete methods and abstract methods.
If an enum class has an abstract method, then each instance of the enum class must implement it*/

// Java program to demonstrate that enums can have
// constructor and concrete methods.

// An enum (Note enum keyword inplace of class keyword)
enum Color 
{
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE;

  // enum constructor called separately for each constant
  private Color()
  {
    System.out.println("Constructor called for : "
            + this.toString());
  }

  public void colorInfo()
  {
    System.out.println("Universal Color");
  }
}

public class Test 
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Color c1 = Color.RED;
    System.out.println(c1);
    c1.colorInfo();
  }
}
