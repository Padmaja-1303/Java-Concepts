Important Points of enum:  

Every enum is internally implemented by using Class.
/* internally above enum Color is converted to
class Color
{
     public static final Color RED = new Color();
     public static final Color BLUE = new Color();
     public static final Color GREEN = new Color();
}*/
Every enum constant represents an object of type enum.
