By default enums have their own string values,
we can also assign some custom values to enums. 
Consider below example for that.

Examples:

enum  Fruits
{
    APPLE(“RED”), BANANA(“YELLOW”), GRAPES(“GREEN”);
}

In above example we can see that the Fruits enum have three members 
i.e APPLE, BANANA and GRAPES with have their own different custom values
RED, YELLOW and GREEN respectively.
